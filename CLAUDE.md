# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

This is the standalone distribution repo for the official "Timeclock"
bundle of [Kintai](https://github.com/AudricSan/Kintai). It used to live
inside the main Kintai monorepo at `src/Bundles/Timeclock/` and was
extracted so it can be installed independently, the same way any
third-party bundle would be (see `docs/creating-a-bundle.md` in the main
Kintai repo for the full bundle distribution model — manifest, registry,
installer).

There is no build or test suite in this repo (no `composer.json`, no
PHPUnit). The code is not runnable or functionally testable standalone: every
class under `src/` depends on `kintai\Core\*` (repositories, middleware,
`Request`/`Response`, `ViewRenderer`, `PermissionService`, etc.) that only
exist inside a running Kintai instance. Verifying a behavior change means
installing the bundle into a real Kintai instance, not running anything in
this repo. CI here only checks PHP syntax and manifest validity (see
"CI and branches" below) — it cannot catch logic errors.

Kintai never `git clone`/`pull`s bundles (many shared-hosting environments
have no `git` CLI available to PHP) — `BundleInstallerService` always
downloads a tagged GitHub Release's zipball. This repo's only "build output"
is therefore the GitHub Release itself; nothing here gets compiled or
packaged.

## CI and branches

This repo mirrors the branch/release model of the main Kintai repo:

- `main`, `alpha`, and `beta` are protected branches — no direct push; land
  changes via a PR (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`). New work targets `alpha` (the
  active channel); promote a line forward by merging `alpha` → `beta` → `main`.
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs a `test` job (PHP syntax check via
  `php -l` on every `.php` file, plus JSON validation of `bundle.json` and
  `lang/*.json`) on every push and PR to these branches. This is the required
  status check gating merges.
- Merging into any of the three branches triggers
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which tags and publishes a GitHub Release
  — see "Release process" below.

## Release process

`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers on push to `alpha`, `beta`, or
`main` (i.e. on every merge, since those branches are protected) and computes
and pushes the tag itself — never tag or `gh release create` by hand:

- Version line `X.Y` comes from `version` in `bundle.json`, which is always
  written as the placeholder `X.Y.0` and is only bumped by hand when opening a
  new release line (new `Y`).
- `alpha`/`beta` merges tag `vX.Y.Z` as a prerelease, where `Z` is the highest
  existing `vX.Y.*` tag + 1 — a counter shared and cumulative across alpha and
  beta within the same line, never reset between them.
- `main` merges tag `vX.Y.0` as the stable release for that line. If `vX.Y.0`
  already exists, the job skips cleanly (a line only ever gets one stable
  release; further fixes require opening a new line).
- Release notes are extracted from `CHANGELOG.md`: `## [Unreleased]` for
  alpha/beta (falling back to `## [X.Y.0]` if `Unreleased` is empty, i.e. the
  release commit already renamed it), or `## [X.Y.0]` directly for `main`. A
  push to a channel with no matching CHANGELOG section fails the job — always
  update `CHANGELOG.md` in your PR before merging.

## Architecture

- `bundle.json` — manifest read by Kintai's bundle installer/registry: slug,
  version, `kintai_core` compatibility range, `entry_class`.
- `src/TimeclockBundle.php` — the entry point
  (`kintai\Bundles\Installed\Timeclock\TimeclockBundle`, extends
  `kintai\Core\BundleContract\Bundle`). **Unlike most bundles, `register()`
  does not bind any repository**: `TimeclockRepositoryInterface` stays bound
  in Kintai Core's own `RepositoryServiceProvider`, because `HomeController`,
  `EmployeeController`'s dashboard, and `DashboardAlertService` all depend
  on it directly (constructor-injected, unconditional) for "clocked in"
  widgets/alerts that must keep working even if this bundle is disabled or
  uninstalled entirely. `register()` only wires up `Views/` and `routes.php`.
  Don't add a repository binding here — it would just shadow the Core one
  and add confusion, not capability.
- `routes.php` — three groups: `/employee/timeclock*` (`AuthMiddleware`
  only — clock in/out, view own history), `/admin/timeclocks*`
  (`AuthMiddleware` + `PermissionMiddleware`, `timeclock.*` permissions), and
  `/api/v1/timeclocks*` (REST, `ApiAuthMiddleware` + `ApiPermissionMiddleware`,
  self-scoped for clock-in/clock-out/index via the `self: 'user_id'`
  permission option).
- `src/Controllers/Web/EmployeeTimeclockController.php` — clock in, clock
  out, view own timeclock history.
- `src/Controllers/Web/AdminTimeclockController.php` — list/edit/delete
  timeclock entries across the organization.
- `src/Controllers/Api/TimeclockController.php` — REST CRUD + clock-in/out
  over the API.
- `Views/employee-timeclock.php`, `Views/timeclocks.php`. Registered under
  the `timeclock::` view namespace.
- `lang/{en,fr,ja}.json` — bundle-scoped translation keys, merged into
  Kintai's `__()` translator. Keys used by `TimeclockBundle` itself
  (`bundle_timeclock`, `bundle_timeclock_desc`) must exist in every locale
  file.
